# Pycharm-Workshop

## Exercise 1 - Create a Pizza

In this exercise you will practise OOP (object orient programming) within PyCharm.  
This type of programming aims to model the real world, defining classes as "blueprints"
of a concept and objects as a concrete instance of the classes. 
For example, you can have the "Dog" class from which you can create concrete instances
like a dog named "Paqui".

In this example there is a pizza shop which has a list of employees, a unique product manager and a 
key-value dictionary with a pizza type and its price.

Complete the main method to create a pizza taking into account:  
  * A Product manager can design pizzas for a concrete shop.
  * An Employee can create a pizza based on a design available in a shop.

Expected Output: Pizza: 10 | status=hot
