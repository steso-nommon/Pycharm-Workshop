# Pycharm-Workshop

## Exercise 3 - Testing, testing and testing.

In this exercise you will practise creating tests and managing exceptions.  

Create a test for when the salary_adjust_percentage of the adjust_salaries method is **exactly 0**.   
The test must verify that a **ValueError** is raised.

You will need to modify the tested function and create a new test.

**Note: you will need to use:**

```
with pytest.raises(Exception):
    my_method()
   ```
